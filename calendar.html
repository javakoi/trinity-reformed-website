                <h2>What is the Church Calendar?</h2>
                <p>The Church Calendar, also known as the Liturgical Year or Christian Year, is a cycle of seasons and holy days that structures the worship and life of the Christian church. It follows the life of Christ from his birth to his resurrection and ascension, and includes the coming of the Holy Spirit and the anticipation of Christ's return. The calendar helps us remember and celebrate the great events of salvation history throughout the year.</p>

                <h2>The Seasons of the Church Year</h2>
                
                <h3>Advent (Late November - December 24)</h3>
                <p>Advent is the season of preparation for the coming of Christ. It begins four Sundays before Christmas and marks the start of the church year. During Advent, we prepare our hearts for both the celebration of Christ's first coming at Christmas and his second coming at the end of time. The color of Advent is purple, symbolizing penitence and preparation.</p>
                
                <h3>Christmas (December 25 - January 5)</h3>
                <p>Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, the incarnation of God in human flesh. This season lasts for twelve days, ending on Epiphany. The color of Christmas is white, symbolizing joy and purity.</p>
                
                <h3>Epiphany (January 6)</h3>
                <p>Epiphany celebrates the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles, particularly the visit of the Magi. It reminds us that Christ came not just for the Jews, but for all people. The color of Epiphany is white.</p>
                
                <h3>Ordinary Time (January 7 - Ash Wednesday)</h3>
                <p>This period between Epiphany and Lent is called "Ordinary Time" because it is not part of a major season. It focuses on the life and ministry of Jesus. The color is green, symbolizing growth and life.</p>
                
                <h3>Lent (Ash Wednesday - Holy Saturday)</h3>
                <p>Lent is a season of penitence and preparation for Easter. It lasts for forty days (not counting Sundays) and begins on Ash Wednesday. During Lent, we focus on repentance, fasting, and spiritual discipline. The color of Lent is purple, symbolizing penitence and royalty.</p>
                
                <h3>Holy Week (Palm Sunday - Holy Saturday)</h3>
                <p>Holy Week is the most sacred week of the church year, commemorating the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry. It includes:</p>

                    <li><strong>Palm Sunday:</strong> Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem</li>
                    <li><strong>Maundy Thursday:</strong> The Last Supper and institution of the Lord's Supper</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Friday:</strong> The crucifixion of Jesus</li>
                    <li><strong>Holy Saturday:</strong> The day Jesus' body lay in the tomb</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Easter (Easter Sunday - Pentecost)</h3>
                <p>Easter is the most important celebration of the Christian year, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The Easter season lasts for fifty days, ending with Pentecost. The color of Easter is white, symbolizing joy and victory.</p>
                
                <h3>Pentecost (50 days after Easter)</h3>
                <p>Pentecost celebrates the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and the birth of the Christian church. The color of Pentecost is red, symbolizing the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                
                <h3>Ordinary Time (After Pentecost - Advent)</h3>
                <p>This long season focuses on the growth and mission of the church. It emphasizes the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers and the mission of the church in the world. The color is green, symbolizing growth and life.</p>
