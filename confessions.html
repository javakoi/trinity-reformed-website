                <h2>What Are Confessions and Catechisms?</h2>
                <p>We affirm that Scripture alone is our ultimate authority as the inspired word of God. Our goal is to be thoroughly saturated with biblical truth that guides both our beliefs and our actions. Throughout church history, faithful believers have created concise doctrinal statements, not to supplant Scripture, but to help teach and preserve the truths found in God's word. These documents are known as "Confessions of Faith."</p>
                
                <p>These confessions serve as valuable resources to help believers develop theological understanding and defend their faith (1 Peter 3:15). However, we must emphasize that they are only beneficial to the extent that they help us better understand and apply the teachings of Scripture.</p>

                <p>The Heidelberg Catechism (1563) is a beloved Reformed catechism that presents Christian doctrine in a warm, pastoral manner. It is organized around three themes: guilt, grace, and gratitude. The catechism uses a question-and-answer format that makes it ideal for teaching and memorization.</p>
                
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Part II: Grace</strong> - Our deliverance through Christ (Questions 12-85)</li>
                    <li><strong>Part III: Gratitude</strong> - Our response of thankfulness (Questions 86-129)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Famous Questions</h3>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> That I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Westminster Shorter Catechism</h2>
                <p>The Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647) is a concise summary of Christian doctrine designed for teaching children and new believers. It consists of 107 questions and answers that cover the essential teachings of the Christian faith.</p>
                
                <h3>Famous Questions</h3>
                <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the chief end of man?</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him?</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Westminster Larger Catechism</h2>
                <p>The Westminster Larger Catechism (1647) provides a more detailed treatment of Christian doctrine than the Shorter Catechism. It consists of 196 questions and answers and is particularly useful for training church officers and for more advanced theological study.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Covenantal Catechesis</h2>
                <p>The primary purpose of catechesis is to nurture in our children a deep understanding of their covenant relationship with God and their place within the church community. Our children must learn their identity in Christ so they can serve faithfully in the church, family, and society. We must disciple our children so that their entire lives become a living affirmation of their baptismal vows.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Purpose of Confessions</h2>
                <p>These confessions and catechisms serve several important purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They provide a standard of doctrine for the church</li>
                    <li>They guard against heresy and error</li>
                    <li>They serve as teaching tools for believers</li>
