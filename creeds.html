                <h2>What Are the Ecumenical Creeds?</h2>
                <p>The ecumenical creeds are ancient statements of Christian faith that have been accepted by the universal church throughout history. They are called "ecumenical" because they represent the consensus of the whole Christian church on essential doctrines. These creeds were formulated in response to various heresies and controversies in the early church and continue to serve as foundational statements of Christian orthodoxy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>
                <p>The Apostles' Creed is the oldest and most widely accepted of the ecumenical creeds. Although not written by the apostles themselves, it summarizes the apostolic teaching and has been used by the church since the second century. It is particularly valued for its simplicity and clarity.</p>

                    <p><strong>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br>
                    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit<br>

                    he descended to hell.<br>
                    The third day he rose again from the dead.<br>
                    He ascended to heaven<br>
                    and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.<br>

                <h2>The Nicene Creed</h2>
                <p>The Nicene Creed was formulated at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and revised at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. It was written primarily to combat the Arian heresy, which denied the full divinity of Christ. This creed provides a more detailed statement of the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

                    For us and for our salvation<br>
                    he came down from heaven:<br>
                    by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
                    he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
                    and was made man.<br>
                    For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>

                <h2>Confessing the Faith Together</h2>
                <p>We confess, believe, and teach the Christian faith as it is summarized in the traditional creeds of the Churchâ€”the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds. When we recite these creeds together, we join with our brothers and sisters in Christ all across the world, at least in this way, to answer His prayer that "they would all be one" (John 17:21).</p>

                <h2>The Importance of the Creeds</h2>
                <p>These ecumenical creeds are important for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They define the essential doctrines of the Christian faith</li>
                    <li>They guard against heresy and false teaching</li>
                    <li>They unite Christians across denominational lines</li>
                    <li>They connect us with the historic Christian tradition</li>
                    <li>They provide a foundation for Christian worship and teaching</li>
                    <li>They serve as a standard of orthodoxy for the church</li>
                </ul>
