                <h1>The Liturgy</h1>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What is Liturgy?</h2>
                <p>Liturgy is the structured order of worship that guides our corporate worship of God. The word "liturgy" comes from the Greek word "leitourgia," meaning "the work of the people." Our worship together is cooperative participation; worship is not a spectator event nor individualistic. A liturgical service is where the pastor and congregation recite, pray, sing, and read printed texts.</p>
                
                <h3>Biblical Foundation</h3>
                <p>Our liturgy is based on biblical patterns of worship found throughout Scripture. We see elements of covenant renewal worship in the Old Testament, particularly in the structure of the temple worship and the festivals. The New Testament church continued these patterns while adapting them to the new covenant reality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Structure of Our Worship</h2>
                
                <h3>1. The Lord Calls Us</h3>
                <p>Call to Worship - The people are called to worship (Lev. 9:5). Our worship is a response to God's summons. He always takes the initiative. We draw near because He first invites us.</p>
                
                <h3>2. The Lord Cleanses Us - <em style="color: #d2691e;">The Sin Offering</em></h3>
                <p>Confession of Sin and Declaration of Absolution - The sin offering (Lev. 9:15) highlights confession of sin and absolution. Without an initial confession of sin, we are worshipping God with unclean hands and unclean lips. But having been washed, we may enter God's presence.</p>
                
                <h3>3. The Lord Consecrates Us - <em style="color: #d2691e;">The Ascension Offering</em></h3>
                <p>Scripture Readings and Sermon - The Lord lifts us up to the heavenly places where we are consecrated by God's Word. We desire to be a people saturated and shaped by God's Word (Deut. 6:6-9). By this word we are converted (Psalm 19:7), convicted (Jer. 23:29), revived (Psalm 119:25), sanctified (John 17:17), made wise (Psalm 19:7), and instructed in every good work (2 Tim. 3:14-17). God speaks to us through His Word, transforming our minds (Rom. 12:1-2), affections (Psalm 119:103), and actions (Psalm 119:67).</p>
                
                <h3>4. The Lord Collects Our Gifts - <em style="color: #d2691e;">The Tribute Offering</em></h3>
                <p>Giving of God's Tithes and our Offerings - The tribute offering (Lev. 9:17) follows, represented by the collection of tithes and offerings.</p>
                
                <h3>5. The Lord Communes With Us - <em style="color: #d2691e;">The Peace Offering</em></h3>
                <p>The Lord's Supper - The peace offering (Lev. 9:18-21) is the climax of the liturgy. This offering is the communion meal we eat in God's presence. All old covenant feasts and festivals were variations of the peace offering. The Lord's Supper, of course, is our peace offering in the new covenant, as God shares his table with us.</p>
                
                <h3>6. The Lord Commissions Us</h3>
                <p>Benediction and Commissioning - We are commissioned. We are sent out with God's benediction (Lev. 9:22-23). At the tabernacle, Aaron raised his hands and blessed the people as he dismissed them (Num. 6:22-27). We are sent out to serve God in the world, carrying his blessing as we go.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Musical Elements</h2>
                <p>Music plays an important role in our worship, serving to praise God, teach doctrine, and unite the congregation in worship.</p>
                
                <h3>Psalms and Hymns</h3>
                <p>The Psalms are the Bible's hymnbook and the church's first songbook. When we have the words of the Psalms in our minds and hearts, we have words to express every experience of life and learn to pray as God desires us to pray. These inspired songs of Scripture provide us with the language of worship that God himself has given to his people.</p>
                
                <p>Traditional hymns are rich with biblical theology that engages both our minds and our hearts, allowing the wisdom of older saints to guide us in the modern Church. These hymns carry the weight of centuries of Christian experience and theological reflection, helping us to worship with the same depth and understanding as generations of believers before us.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Psalms - The inspired songs of Scripture</li>
                    <li>Traditional hymns - Classic songs of the faith</li>
                    <li>Responsive readings - Congregational participation in Scripture</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Covenant Renewal Pattern</h2>
                <p>Our worship follows a biblical pattern that reflects God's covenant relationship with his people, based on the Levitical offerings described in Scripture. This pattern includes six essential elements that correspond to the biblical offerings:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Calls Us</strong> - The Call to Worship (Lev. 9:5)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Cleanses Us</strong> - The Sin Offering (Lev. 9:15)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Consecrates Us</strong> - The Ascension Offering (Lev. 9:16)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Collects Our Gifts</strong> - The Tribute Offering (Lev. 9:17)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Communes With Us</strong> - The Peace Offering (Lev. 9:18-21)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lord Commissions Us</strong> - Benediction and Commissioning (Lev. 9:22-23)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each element serves to renew our covenant relationship with God and strengthen our bonds as a Christian community. While some may find our structured approach unfamiliar, we believe that consistent patterns in worship help to form us spiritually over time. The repetition of certain prayers, responses, and actions creates a rhythm that shapes our hearts and minds, helping us to internalize the truths of our faith and grow in our relationship with God.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Purpose of Liturgy</h2>
                <p>Our liturgy serves several important purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It provides structure and order to our worship</li>
                    <li>It ensures that all essential elements of worship are included</li>
                    <li>It helps us focus on God rather than on our own preferences</li>
                    <li>It connects us with the historic Christian tradition</li>
                    <li>It shapes us as a community of faith</li>
                    <li>It prepares us to serve God in the world</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
