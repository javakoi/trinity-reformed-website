                <h2>Baptism</h2>
                <p>Baptism is the sacrament of initiation into the Christian church. It is a visible sign and seal of God's covenant of grace, administered in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Through baptism, we are united to Christ in his death and resurrection, and we receive the promise of forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                
                <h3>Infant Baptism</h3>
                <p>We practice infant baptism, believing that children of believing parents are members of the covenant community and should receive the sign of the covenant. This practice is rooted in the biblical pattern of household baptisms and the continuity of God's covenant promises from the Old Testament to the New.</p>
                
                <h3>The Meaning of Baptism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Washing away of sins (Acts 22:16)</li>
                    <li>Union with Christ in his death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4)</li>
                    <li>Receiving the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38)</li>
                    <li>Entry into the visible church (1 Corinthians 12:13)</li>
                    <li>Sign and seal of the covenant of grace</li>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Lord's Supper</h2>
                <p>The Lord's Supper, also called Holy Communion or the Eucharist, is the sacrament of spiritual nourishment. It is a visible sign and seal of our participation in the body and blood of Christ, strengthening our faith and uniting us with Christ and with one another.</p>
                
                <h3>Covenant Renewal</h3>
                <p>The Lord's Supper serves as the central act of covenant renewal in our worship. Through this sacred meal, we participate in the new covenant established by Christ's death and resurrection. As we partake of the bread and wine together as God's family, we are spiritually nourished by Christ himself, reaffirming our covenant relationship with God and with one another.</p>
                
                <p>This communion meal represents the pinnacle of our worship service, where we celebrate the peace we have with God through Christ and the unity we share as members of his body. We welcome all baptized believers who are in good standing with their churches to join us at the Lord's table, recognizing that this sacred meal belongs to all of God's people and serves as a visible sign of our shared faith in Christ.</p>
                
                <h3>The Meaning of the Lord's Supper</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remembrance of Christ's death (1 Corinthians 11:24-25)</li>
                    <li>Spiritual nourishment and strengthening (John 6:53-58)</li>
                    <li>Communion with Christ and his people (1 Corinthians 10:16-17)</li>
                    <li>Proclamation of the Lord's death until he comes (1 Corinthians 11:26)</li>
                    <li>Anticipation of the heavenly banquet</li>

                <h2>Sacramental Theology</h2>
                <p>We believe that the sacraments are not merely symbolic acts, but are means of grace through which God works in the lives of his people. They are visible words that communicate the gospel message and strengthen our faith. The sacraments derive their efficacy from the work of the Holy Spirit and the word of institution, not from the worthiness of the minister or the recipient.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The sacraments are instituted by Christ</li>
                    <li>They are signs and seals of the covenant of grace</li>
                    <li>They are means of grace, not merely symbols</li>
                    <li>They require faith for their proper reception</li>
                    <li>They are administered by ordained ministers</li>
                </ul>
